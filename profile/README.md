# HubDM

## Making GitHub Social Again

Have you ever wanted to privately contact a repository owner about something or informally chat with your friends on GitHub? Since GitHub removed their private messaging feature, it's been difficult to communicate with GitHub members without revealing sensitive personal information. With HubDM, you can chat with repository owners and users alike!

## When is HubDM coming?

HubDM is currently not available for public access, but we're planning to open our beta soon.
